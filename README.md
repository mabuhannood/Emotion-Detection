# Emotion Detection

This project involves detecting emotions from facial expressions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Dense model. The dataset contains 35,685 grayscale images (48x48 pixels) of faces, categorized by emotions such as happiness, neutral, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, and fear. The CNN extracts features from these images, while the Dense model classifies the emotions.
